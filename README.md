# Artificial-Neural-Network
An artificial neural network capable of deep learning written in Java.

I wrote this a long time ago. If it were today, I would change quite a lot. In the meantime though it is not so bad. In it's current form, it can support nearly any kind of network layout except recurring. I have tested it by training on the NMIST database. It was able to properly categorize 93% of the training data.

In the future, I would develop a more sophisticated interface for it, design for paralellization, and have ways to generate more network types.
